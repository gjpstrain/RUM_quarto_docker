# RUM_quarto_docker
Repository for my RUM Quarto/Docker workshop which I delivered to the R user group at the University of Manchester on 29/09/2024.

Written instructions are included in the pdf. Additionally, the `test_quart.qmd` file contains an example of how to use model caching.

Following the instructions in the pdf should result in a repository very similar to this one.
